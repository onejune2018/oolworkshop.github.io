title: "Generative Graph Perturbations for Scene Graph Prediction"
abstract: "Inferring objects and their relationships from an image is useful in many applications at the intersection of vision and language. Due to a long tail data distribution, the task is challenging, with the inevitable appearance of zero-shot compositions of objects and relationships at test time. Current models often fail to properly understand a scene in such cases, as during training they only observe a tiny fraction of the distribution corresponding to the most frequent compositions. This motivates us to study whether increasing the diversity of the training distribution, by generating replacement for parts of real scene graphs, can lead to better generalization? We employ generative adversarial networks (GANs) conditioned on scene graphs to generate augmented visual features. To increase their diversity, we propose several strategies to perturb the conditioning. One of them is to use a language model, such as BERT, to synthesize plausible yet still unlikely scene graphs. By evaluating our model on Visual Genome, we obtain both positive and negative results. This prompts us to make several observations that can potentially lead to further improvements."
